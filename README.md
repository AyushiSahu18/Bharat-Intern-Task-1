# Project title
Stock Prediction

# Overview
Stock values is very valuable but extremely hard to predict correctly for any human being on their own. This project seeks to solve the problem of Stock Prices Prediction by utilizing Deep Learning models, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network algorithms, to predict future stock values. Historical data about the stock values that have been publicly listed in Kaggle has been used in this project and I have used the stock value data of ‘Tesla’.

# Aim
Take the stock price of any company you want and predict its price by using LSTM.

# Technical objectives
The technical objectives will be implemented in Python. The system must be able to access a list of historical prices. It must calculate the estimated price of stock based on the historical data for the next 30 days. It must also provide an instantaneous visualization of the market index in a neatly formatted Python-Based Web App.

# Libraries used
- Pandas 
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Matplot lib
- Tensorflow
